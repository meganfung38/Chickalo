Somewhat Agree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,"I like the overall concept of the app, to help people feel more connected (if they want) in public spaces. I think with more development, it has a lot of room for success. ","I think that the app is still in its very early stage since the app layout is very basic, does not have many functions besides the map and profile editing, and is kind of laggy with location tracking. The location tracking was spotty and not as smooth as it needs to be for the app to be functionally useful. ","If the location tracking was improved and users were able to message other users, I think this app would be more functional. Right now it works exactly like how snapchat maps works which is fine but doesn't really serve the proposed purpose of the app (networking, connecting with strangers, etc.)","chats with other users. this was part of post discussion, but I think your idea to implement business users that can promote their deals/ products would be very cool-- I'd use it to find deals near me. Other features to make the map more interactive would be cool too. ","For the most part yes? I don't know how location tracking works and I don't typically share my location on apps so I don't know what the definition of 'safe' is. As long as my activity toggle works as intended and a large enough user base is established, I think I would be comfortable using this app.  ","Its an app like snap maps, only everyone is anonymous and is more targeted towards meeting new people rather than seeing which of your friends are near.",6,
Somewhat Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,I liked the cute avatars that we could customize. ,"the location tracking is a bit finicky. It works overall but has a hard time loading when toggling between pages of the app. Also I noticed that turning the toggle on and off takes time to update. Although the bubble headline text is cute, I think it kind of distracts and serves no actual purpose for the app (with the current features which are limited)-- the headlines were overlapping with other users. ",if everything worked as intended and seamlessly. ,I liked what we talked about in our discussion after testing about allowing users to friend other users they know and seeing them on the map as your friend with their actual name. I think this would add a nice layer on top of being anonymous to the public. I think that there should also be an option to be active but only for people who are your friends. ,yes i think. activity toggle works as intended. I honestly don't share my location regularly on apps and if i do it isn't indefinitely so not sure how realistic it would be for me to use this app often. ,"Simple app that is great for networking purposes. With the current features, I think that its potential works for networking events where people can have fun headlines that prompt other users to start conversations with (in person). ",7,
Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Agree,Agree,It was fun to test out and act out the scenarios. I think that the app serves as a useful tool for all the use cases we played out. ,"the map visual doesn't really follow your avatar around based off location. like moving across the room, I had to move the map so that I can still see my avatar within the dimensions of the screen. I also think that the map visual should have a cap for how far away a user can explore. users shouldn't be able to explore more than maybe 7-10 miles away from their current location since it takes away from being present in the user's current space.",The map visual should have a cap for how far away a user can explore. users shouldn't be able to explore more than maybe 7-10 miles away from their current location since it takes away from being present in the user's current space.,"more interactive features like friends, event pinning, building markers for parties? ","not sure how safe I feel turning my activity on if I were to use this app in a public space. I think I'd only use it if I were with friends at a party, private event, and maybe school. I'd be scared to use this app in public spaces like cafes, malls, etc. (stalking, weird people knowing where I am). ",A fun app to connect with strangers in person. ,5,Great app but I'd need to get use to the idea of sharing my location with the public. I'd need a large audience on this app for me to give into participating. 
Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Somewhat Agree,Agree,Agree,the idea for the app is really good. everything in the settings page works perfectly. avatars are super cute. ,features are limited so app isn't really entertaining or addicting to use (yet?). I think more add ons would make this app more fun to use. Right now there isn't much you can do on the app. ,"If there were more features that would help users connect: messaging, friend requests, special avatar features (business account, influencer account, etc.). ","I think allowing users to message each other should be the next feature to add since it would help break the ice between users before talking in person and make the app feel more social than visual. Right now the map is just a map of avatars, not that much to do. ",yes. activity toggle works good. ,Chickalo is an app that allows you to anonymously meet people and explore your surroundings. ,8,
