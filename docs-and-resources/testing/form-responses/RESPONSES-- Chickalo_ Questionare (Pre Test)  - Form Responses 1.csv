I also spend a lot of my time on the instagram explore page where I can see suggested content-- people I may know + their posts, events happening around me, things the algorithm think I enjoy engaging with like food reels, EE jokes, beauty recommendations.

I like that these apps allow me to silently watch people's lives without needing to respond/ react to it. It makes me feel more connected to my general circle of friends + family and helps to keep me informed about current world events, more personal events (friends traveling adventures, what's trending, suggestions for where I should explore near me-- places, restaurants, activities, etc.).

I mainly use the explore page where I can see things the algorithm thinks I enjoy watching-- makeup, shopping deals, outfits, pretty places, nice restaurants, recipes. I really like that it builds a sense of community.

21,Female,Computer Science,emailmeganfung@gmail.com,iphone 14 pro,18.6.2,Daily,I use instagram and snapchat the most. Instagram because seeing what other people are up to is entertaining-- makes me feel like I am a watching everyone's life movie-- and I also really like the curated feed instagram collects on my explore page. Snapchat is fun cause I like snapping my close friends (sending pictures back and forth). I get a daily look into what they are doing at times in the day and feels a little more personal than instagram. ,Yes,Depends on what app it is,Yes
