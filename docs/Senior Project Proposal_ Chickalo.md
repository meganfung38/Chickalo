**Project Name: Chickalo** 

*an anonymous, consent based mobile app for spontaneous social interaction in public spaces* **\- Abstract Overview** 

\- In an increasingly digital world, **organic spontaneous social interactions** in public spaces have become rare. Social anxiety, fear of rejection, and the perceived awkwardness of approaching strangers prevent many from engaging face to face. **Chickalo is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap by facilitating anonymous, consent based connections between individuals in shared physical spaces**. Utilizing an interactive, avatar populated map, Chickalo enables users to interact safely and playfully in their immediate environment. 

**Problem Statement:** 

\- Despite the internet connecting billions globally, **individuals often struggle to initiate real world conversations with strangers**. Public settings, where natural interaction opportunities arise, are instead dominated by digital isolation: headphones in, heads down, and disengagement. Factors like social anxiety, fear of awkwardness, and safety concerts create invisible social barriers. 

\- This problem is especially prevalent among younger demographics who are tech savvy but socially cautious. There is a clear lack of platforms designed to encourage public, real life engagement while maintaining privacy and consent. 

**Proposed Solution:** 

\- Chickalo proposes a **mobile application** where **users appear on a map as anonymous avatars** when their “activity” toggle is turned on. Within a set p**roximity (eg. 100 ft), users can view other active users** 

\- **If time permits, users will be able to interact via temporary, anonymous messaging**.  
**Core Features:** 

**\- User Profiles and Friend System** 

**\- Users must create an account** 

\- Email, password, customized avatar, headline/ note/ thought/ question to introduce themselves 

\- New accounts will have a randomly generated username created for them (which is what will appear with their avatar) 

**\- Users can friend other users after mutual agreement** 

\- Friends’ avatars display differently on the map for easy recognition 

**\- Activity Toggle** 

**\- Users control when their avatar appears on the map** 

\- “Activity” on → user’s avatar will appear on map for everyone within a 100 ft proximity and can view other nearby avatars 

\- “Activity off → map view becomes empty and hidden 

**\- Avatar and Map Interface** 

\- Map renders **businesses, locations, and users** within 100 ft proximity 

**\- Business and Advertising Features** 

\- Businesses (restaurants, stores, companies, influencers etc.) can register profiles \- Business profiles appear on the map with **special offers, announcements, or promotions** 

\- Potential **future premium features for business visibility**  
**Features to Implement if Time Permits:** 

**\- Anonymous Messaging System** 

\- Users can **initiate anonymous conversations** with other active users (responding to their headline/ note/ thought) 

\- By default, **messages disappear after 24 hrs** unless both users agree to save them 

**\- Safety and Moderation Tools** 

**\- Users can block/ report others** 

\- Blocked users will not appear on the map for both parties regardless of 

“Activity” status 

\- Reported users will be flagged for review 

\- Offensive **language filters** 

\- No **image** sharing 

\- Repeat **offenses** lead to **bans** 

**\- Event Mode** 

\- Event host can **create events** generating unique codes 

\- Event **attendees** can use the code for special features 

\- Appear with real names instead of avatars (optional) 

\- Event specific interaction features (icebreakers/ networking prompts/ etc) 

**\- Notifications and Background Functionality** 

\- Users can receive notification if they get messages while app is in the background (“Activity” is on without app open)  
**User Stories** 

**\- New User (Registration/ Account Set Up)** 

1\. Jessica just moved to San Francisco and is feeling lonely. 

2\. Jessica hears about Chickalo and decides to download it and create an account. 3\. Jessica registers using her email, creates a password, customizes her avatar, and writes “Newly moved into the city” to her headline. 

4\. Jessica successfully creates her account and is given the randomly generated username, JadeStoneGecko32. 

5\. Jessica goes out to the bars for the first time since moving in and turns her Chickalo “Activity” on. 

6\. Jessica is approached at the bars and becomes friends with other active users, welcoming her to the city. 

**\- Regular User** 

1\. Alex, a freshman at Cal Poly, is at 1901 Marketplace. Alex missed his morning Physics class and therefore did not get to select a lab group. 

2\. Alex turns on his Chickalo “Activity” and edits his headline to say “In need of a Physics lab group. In Fraser’s 9am section” 

3\. Another active user nearby sees Alex’s headline on their Chickalo map. They have one extra spot in their lab group. 

4\. They decide to approach and invite Alex to join their lab group. 

5\. Alex, relieved, now has a lab group. 

**\- Business Owner (Advertising Locally)** 

1\. A local boutique uses Chickalo to promote their limited time sale. 

2\. They appear on the map of any user within 100 ft as a pin (representing a non-user; instead a business). 

3\. Users nearby see “20% off all jewelry today\!” encouraging foot traffic. 

4\. A user, in the area, looking for a gift for her daughter, sees this promotion and makes their way over to the local boutique. 

5\. The user ends up getting some cute jewelry for her daughter\!  
**\- Event Host (Networking Mixer)** 

1\. Cal Poly’s career center hosts a networking mixer. 

2\. It is encouraged that attendees download Chickalo, turn their “activity” on while at the event, and add fun questions/ conversation starters to their avatar headline. 3\. Users who participated in doing so, ended up meeting and talking to a lot more people than they usually would at events like these. 

a. Fun questions/ conversation starters encourage organic social interaction without having to awkwardly force a chat with someone who is uninterested. 4\. After the event, users can decide whether to friend each other for future communication.  
**Similar Projects/ Inspiration**

| App  | Similarity  | Difference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **SnapChat**  | Snapchat’s Snap Map allows users to **view their friends’ real time locations on a map  interface**, which echoes  Chickalo’s map based  visualization of user presence. The interactive, location aware map system provides a **useful UI reference for designing  Chickalo’s avatar and map features**. | Snap Map is **only available between existing friends**– there is no functionality for  discovering or connecting with nearby strangers. The  experience is static and  observational rather than  interactive. **Snap Map does not encourage organic public  interaction with strangers or emphasize anonymity**, which are core tenets of Chickalo’s mission. |
| **PokemonGo**  | PokemonGo offers an **engaging, gamified map interface that visualizes user location and generates pins representing real-world elements like  PokeStops and Gyms.** This type of geospatial rendering provides a *solid precedent for how  Chickalo can visualize avatars, businesses, or event hubs within a 100 ft radius*. | Despite the similar visual  presentation, PokemonGo’s purpose is **entirely game based with no intended social  interaction between players in physical proximity**. It lacks real time user discovery or social exchange features. **Chickalo transforms the map mechanic from a gameplay feature into a tool for real world human connection**. |
| **Yubo**  | **Yubo is a social platform  focused on introducing users to others in a relatively  anonymous way, often used to meet new people online**. Its messaging and interest based browsing provides some  **conceptual parallels to  Chickalo’s ephemeral and consent based communication**. | Yubo **lacks any form of real world spatial awareness or proximity based interaction. It operates like a traditional chat/ match app without any  features designed to facilitate public, spontaneous interaction** or on the fly discovery in shared spaces. C**hickalo’s emphasis on real time, map based social immersion is its key  differentiator**. |

| Black Mirror (Nosedive  Episode)-- people rate  each other from 1-5  stars for every  interaction they have. A  person’s rating impacts  their socioeconomic  status. | The episode explores how digital platforms can influence and augment real life  interactions, drawing attention to the performative and  transactional nature of  reputation driven encounters in public. Chickalo similarly  engages with public social behavior mediated by  technology. | While both involve social  dynamics influenced by digital presence, Chickalo’s goal is to encourage low pressure,  consensual interaction and does not incorporate ratings, surveillance, or consequence tied to reputation. The  comparison highlights the need for ethical, non exploitative design in public facing tech. Chickalo leans towards playful, safe connection not judgement. |
| ----- | :---- | :---- |
| **Foursquare**  | **Foursquare pioneered real time location based services by encouraging users to “check in” at public places and discover nearby businesses and event**s. Like Chickalo, it creates a digital layer over physical space,  emphasizing local discovery and social presence. | **Foursquare’s interaction model is business centric and  historical**: users share where they’ve been and leave reviews/ tips. It doesn’t support  anonymous, ephemeral  interaction with nearby users. In contrast, **Chickalo focuses on real time visibility and person to person discovery with  privacy preserving avatars rather than public profiles.** |

While Chickalo draws inspiration from several existing applications and media representations, its unique synthesis of features sets it apart as a novel concept. For example, **Snapchat’s Snap Map** allows users to see the real-time location of friends on a map. This feature demonstrates the potential of geographic visualization in a mobile interface, which Chickalo adapts. However, Snap Map only supports visibility between existing friends, and there is no opportunity to discover or engage with new people in public. Chickalo diverges by emphasizing anonymous discovery and consent-based interaction in real-time, shared environments, effectively reimagining the map not as a tracking tool, but as a dynamic social playground. 

Similarly, **Pokemon GO** offers a visually rich, location-based interface with avatars and proximity-triggered events, which serves as a UI and experience reference for Chickalo’s map functionality. Yet while Pokemon GO uses location awareness for gameplay, Chickalo applies it to foster human interaction. Instead of gamifying space through objectives and rewards, Chickalo uses the same  
spatial logic to encourage spontaneous, real-world connection—particularly for users who may be socially anxious or new to a location. 

Another relevant comparison is **Yubo**, a platform that connects users for anonymous chatting. While Yubo supports meeting new people, it lacks a physical or real-world context—conversations are disconnected from shared environments. Chickalo fills this gap by using proximity as the foundation for its interaction logic, encouraging users to connect with those literally nearby while still preserving privacy and safety through avatars. 

Lastly, another notable reference is **Foursquare**, one of the earliest platforms to gamify real world exploration through digital check-ins. Foursquare allows users to discover nearby businesses, leave tips, and connect with friends based on physical location– laying the groundwork for modern location aware applications. Like Chickalo, it layers a social interface on top of the real world and encourages users to interact with their environment in new ways. However, while Foursquare is rooted in sharing past activity and engaging with fixed locations, Chickalo’s focus is on real-time, anonymous social presence– not historical data. Instead of interacting with places, Chickalo encourages users to engage with people in shared spaces, promoting spontaneous connection rather than curated check-ins. 

Together, these references validate both the technical feasibility and the social value of Chickalo, while also highlighting how it innovates by blending existing models into a new, people-first experience for spontaneous public connection.
